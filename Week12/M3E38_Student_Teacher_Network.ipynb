The dataset contains 60,000 Handwritten digits as training samples and 10,000 Test samples, which means each digit occurs 6000 times in the training set and 1000 times in the testing set (approximately). \n","2. Each image is Size Normalized and Centered. \n","3. Each image is 28 X 28 Pixel with 0-255 Gray Scale Value. \n","4. That means each image is represented as 784 (28 X28) dimension vector where each value is in the range 0- 255.\n","\n","###History\n","\n","Yann LeCun (Director of AI Research, Facebook, Courant Institute, NYU) was given the task of identifying the cheque numbers (in the 90’s) and the amount associated with that cheque without manual intervention. That is when this dataset was created which raised the bars and became a benchmark.\n","\n","Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes (Google Labs, New York) hold the copyright of MNIST dataset, which is a subset of the original NIST datasets. This dataset is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license. \n","\n","It is the handwritten digits dataset in which half of them are written by the Census Bureau employees and remaining by the high school students. The digits collected among the Census Bureau employees are easier and cleaner to recognize than the digits collected among the students.\n","\n","\n","###Challenges\n","\n","Now, if you notice the images below, you will find that between 2 characters there are always certain similarities and differences. To teach a machine to recognize these patterns and identify the correct output is intriguing.\n","\n","![altxt](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Radu_Tudor_Ionescu/publication/282924675/figure/fig3/AS:319968869666820@1453297931093/A-random-sample-of-6-handwritten-digits-from-the-MNIST-data-set-before-and-after.png)\n","\n","Hence, all these challenges make this a good problem to solve in Machine Learning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Vg5qc_aK4jep","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Domain Information"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mqb5Lo754l-q","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Handwriting changes person to person.

There are several ways to perform image classification. However, the performance of image classification can often be significantly improved by combining multiple models together which are called ensemble methods. Though beneficial, ensemble methods can be computationally expensive.\n","\n","Therefore, an alternative approach, appropriate for deep learning schemes, is to adopt student-teacher training. \n","\n","In this training approach, there is a huge neural network known as the teacher network which performs classification tasks. There is also a much smaller student network which learns to perform the same tasks by taking the learnt weights of the teacher network. The weights passed from teacher to student are softened weights, ensuring that student is thus smaller. The student can also be small in terms of number of layers in the network.\n","\n","We can look at the student - teacher network sample below:\n","\n","<img src =
